Variant finder.
This program will read in either a table or a text insert of your interest.
It will scan the table or the text to find c. or p. names of variants.
It will then grab those names and present the full name and from it extract the gene in which the variant has been reported, the base change position, the codon position, the Wildtype Seq(or base), the variant seq(base), Wildtype AA, and Variant AA.

Base: Also known as Nucleobases, or nitrogenous bases or often simply bases, are nitrogen-containing biological compounds that form nucleosides, and constitute the basic building blocks of nucleic acids. Five nucleobases—adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), thymine (T), and uracil (U)—are called primary or canonical. They function as the fundamental units of the genetic code, with the bases A, G, C, and T being found in DNA while A, G, C, and U are found in RNA. Thymine and uracil are identical excepting that T includes a methyl group that U lacks.
       
       A<->T or U
       G<->C

AA = amino acids
 Amino acids are the building blocks from which proteins are constructed. These organic compounds are coded by a triplet of DNA bases. There are 20 of them that are coded by a genetic sequences.

Codon: A unit that consists of three adjacent bases on a DNA molecule and that determines the position of a specific amino acid in a protein molecule during protein synthesis.

Wildtype: The form or forms of a gene sequence commonly occurring in nature in a given species. 

Variant: An alteration in the most common DNA base(s) sequence.
